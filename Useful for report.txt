## GOOD FOR REPORT

# INTRO

The success of a machine learning project is often crucially dependent on the choice of good hyperparameters. As machine learning continues to mature as a field, relying on trial and error to find good values for these parameters (also known as “grad student descent”) simply doesn’t scale.

# Keras Tuner

Keras Tuner is an easy-to-use, distributable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of performing a hyperparameter search. Keras Tuner makes it easy to define a search space and leverage included algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values. Keras Tuner comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in, and is also designed to be easy for researchers to extend in order to experiment with new search algorithms.
